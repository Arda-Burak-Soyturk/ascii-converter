# Image to ASCII Art Converter

A lightweight, command-line Python utility that converts images into terminal-renderable ASCII art. Ideal for hobby projects, retro visualization, or CLI aesthetic tools.

## Project Purpose

This tool was developed to enhance my programming portfolio with a practical, visually impactful, and modular Python application. It demonstrates:

- Image processing with Pillow
- ASCII rendering logic
- Modular Python codebase
- CLI input/output handling

## Features

- Converts any image format (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, etc.)
- Grayscale-to-ASCII brightness mapping
- Automatic image resizing and aspect ratio correction
- Outputs to both terminal and `.txt` file
- Modular structure for future enhancements (e.g., color support, GUI)

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pillow
